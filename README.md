# SUNY Brockport Hazen Health Center mHealth Application

The SUNY Brockport Hazen Health Center App serves as a streamlined tool for students and staff to access health-related information, schedule appointments, and utilize resources. The app's intuitive SwiftUI frontend and SQL database schema enhance the user experience and data management.
## Description

As part of a SUNY Brockport research project, our team, comprised of authors Elijah Tay and Corey Bright, constructed the Hazen Health Portal's SwiftUI frontend. Our aim was to create a user-friendly interface that offers easy access to crucial health information, appointment scheduling, and various resources. To bolster the app's functionality, we implemented a sophisticated SQL database schema along with triggers, elevating the data management capabilities of the Hazen Health Portal. Looking ahead, an upcoming student team will build upon our work by optimizing and adapting the architecture using Firebase, ensuring compatibility with iOS devices and further enhancing the app's overall user experience. This project stands as a testament to SUNY Brockport's commitment to the well-being of its community, highlighting collaboration and innovation at its core.
